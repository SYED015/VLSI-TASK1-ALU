DESIGN A BASIC ALU SUPPORTING OPERATIONS LIKE ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, AND, OR, AND NOT.

DELIVERABLE: A VERILOG/VHDL CODE, TESTBENCH, AND SIMULATION REPORT.

** In task 1 of this project, I concluded the design and implementation of an arithmetic logical unit (ALU). An EDR is an essential component in any digital processing system and is responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. This task involved the use of Verilog programming and simulation techniques to create, check and validate design.

For starters, I studied the functional requirements of a basic al. This includes arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction, and logical operations such as and, or and xor. Ara can also perform shift operations or comparison tasks. After I understood these main functions, I started planning how to implement them using Verilog, a hardware description language used to design digital circuits.

The Verilog program was written by dividing Ara into manageable modules. Each module corresponded to a specific operation. I used case statements to differentiate operations based on control inputs. The inputs <img width="1920" height="567" alt="T1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f85194eb-d931-434a-b60b-8e4a61db26dc" />
and outputs were set using input and output words in Verilog. I also always used blocks triggered by changes in the input to perform the necessary logical or arithmetic calculations.

After the coding was completed, I went to simulate the design. Simulation is an essential step in hardware design as it allows you to check functionality without creating real hardware. For this purpose, I created a Verilog Testbench. TestBench has applied a variety of input combinations to the ALD and monitored the output to verify that it corresponded to the expected results. With that, I was able to identify and correct any bug in the design.

The simulation helped ensure that each operation functioned correctly for different input scenarios. For example, the test checked how the alu was executed.
